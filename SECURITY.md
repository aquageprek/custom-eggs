## Reporting a security vulnerability

If you find some really serious security issue, please don't create a GitHub issue for it in the first line - it could put all users of the eggs in this repository at risk.
Send a mail to [this email][reportmail] instead, to keep it structured you can simply copy our bug template into your mail.
