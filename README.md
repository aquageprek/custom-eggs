# Custom Eggs
In this repository you find some custom eggs that do not fit in the official [parkervcp/eggs](https://github.com/parkervcp/eggs) repository like webservers or very specific software.

## Links to Eggs

## DockerHub

Here is the link to the Docker Hub repository with the Docker images: [https://hub.docker.com/r/lazybytez/eggs](https://hub.docker.com/r/lazybytez/eggs)

## Webservers and Nginx

We once had a `nginx / php` egg. But The problem is that nginx is **not secure** to use with pterodactyl. So we won't do any **NGINX** related eggs anymore.   
But other webservers like **Caddy** etc. which don't use root are welcome.
