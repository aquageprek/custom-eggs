# Custom Eggs
In this repository you find some custom eggs that do not fit in the official [parkervcp/eggs](https://github.com/parkervcp/eggs) repository like webservers or very specific software.

## Links to Eggs

### Services
- [nginx-fpm](/eggs/nginx-fpm/)
- [grafana-image-renderer](/eggs/grafana-image-renderer/)

## DockerHub

Here is the link to the Docker Hub repository with the Docker images: [https://hub.docker.com/r/lazybytez/eggs](https://hub.docker.com/r/lazybytez/eggs)

## Webservers and Nginx

We had a `nginx / php` egg in this repository which has been removed. The NGINX egg did not reach the quality standard we wanted and was **not really secure**. The NGINX egg has been replaced with a Caddy egg that is way more configurable and secure.
